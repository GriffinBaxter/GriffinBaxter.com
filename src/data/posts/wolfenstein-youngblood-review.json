So, when a new co-operative game in the series was announced during E3 2018, I was intrigued. Due to Machine Games’ track record and my experience with the series, I expected an entertaining spinoff akin to Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, that adds to and builds upon the narrative of the previous games.",

However, this wasn’t possible a lot of the time, as there were certain levels that the players had to reach to realistically complete certain story missions. This fact was poorly communicated which lead to time-wasting trying to progress through the main game.",

Ultimately, we just wanted to push through and finish the game’s story. However, this endeavour was not even worth it on its own. While the story did have a couple of cool moments, the majority of it was simply uninteresting. This was entirely unlike the previous games in the Wolfenstein series.",

However, there is a huge caveat to this, as changes were made to the gunplay that negatively affected the experience. Certain enemies were more vulnerable to certain weapons depending on their armour type, which ultimately ended up being an annoying mechanic. While the base gunplay is fun, the fact that almost every enemy feels like a bullet sponge makes the game very tedious to play at points.",

In fact, many of the game’s elements were negatively affected due to its co-op nature. One such element is reading things in the game, where due to the online nature, the game cannot be paused, which often renders this action useless. Another is pressing a button to boost the other player, which didn’t add anything meaningful to the gameplay.",

However, it does showcase some great graphical prowess and runs great on PC. But overall, Youngblood has too many frustrating and uninteresting moments. It feels as though a rushed Wolfenstein game was put together, with co-op tacked on without any real benefit or point. A Way Out is an example of a good co-op game, where its design clearly revolves around co-operative play, leading to a unique experience. Whereas on the other hand, Youngblood does not use co-op in any meaningful fashion. Even though the previous three games were such great experiences, I cannot recommend Wolfenstein: Youngblood, even to a fan of the franchise. The game is a below-average experience and especially disappointing when compared to the previous, excellent games in the Wolfenstein series.",
