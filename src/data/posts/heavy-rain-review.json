Most of the game’s interactions made use of gestures that require the player to move the mouse or controller in the direction of the character’s actions. This movement style is seemingly typical of Quantic Dream, the game’s developer. I had played their previous game, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, before starting Heavy Rain, which utilised the same mechanic. Unfortunately, there were some moments in my playthrough where certain actions were unreasonably hard to perform. However, these were only occasional and not a huge setback to the enjoyment of the game. The unreasonable movements could be explained by the way controller inputs were ported to mouse and keyboard by the game’s developer.",

The game uses a somewhat dated method of having set camera positions when walking around the environment. Unfortunately, this often causes the movement controls to not work as expected during camera angle transitions. However, these are minor problems that are infrequent enough to not be annoying. And in fact, there were some intentionally tricky controls that worked well. One example was having to press up to five buttons on the keyboard at once while performing additional actions, whereas at the same time the controlled character is going through a tough and awkward manoeuvre in-game. Overall, the game’s unique movement system works well in many areas and is a great addition to the game’s interactivity.",

The camera shots and placements are brilliant alongside the game’s expertly crafted environments. These elements create an immersive experience alongside the game’s accompanying music. While the game repeats many of its songs throughout the campaign, the music is deliberately utilised to showcase the differences and various situations that the characters find themselves in. This makes it so that every character has their own unique theme. Many scenes throughout the game cleverly utilise split-screen for showing different things happening at the same time, similar to scenes within the game ‘A Way Out’. I’m a huge fan of this type of cinematography and it works great in a game. An example of its use in Heavy Rain was for having one part of the screen used for gameplay and another for showing what else is happening at the same time. The only real criticism I could make in terms of the game’s environment would be one of the character’s ‘futuristic’ gadgets and HUD, which end up looking dated and tacky.",
