Using the arrow keys, the deer can be rotated. Additionally, the two-tone and pencil shading rendering methods can be swapped between. The NPR makes use of mipmaps for the pencil strokes, silhouette and crease edge highlighting using triangle adjacency primitives, variable edge thickness, local curvature estimation for the pencil textures, multi-texture blending, and mesh simplification.",
