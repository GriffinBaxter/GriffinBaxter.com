The gameplay can be exciting and fun at times, especially during the scripted, parkour action sequences, of which are visually stunning. However, those parts of the game are unfortunately few and far between. Most of the game involves walking around and solving mundane puzzles. The gunplay and combat sections are easily the worst parts of the game, with uninspiring third-person shooting mechanics and weirdly balanced enemies. Some of the game’s puzzles can be quite egregious and finicky to solve, especially with many of the physics related puzzles.",

And it wasn’t like the game just got more difficult over time, the easy and hard parts were mixed in between each other with no real significance to the harder sections of the game, in terms of the story point or situation.",

I believe it is an above average-game due to the game’s brilliant parkour action sequences, of which are unfortunately bogged down by mundane Tomb Raider gameplay.",
