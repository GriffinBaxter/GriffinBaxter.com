The map tab allows routes and airports to be visualised via the Google Maps API. Selected routes from the routes tab can be loaded into the emissions tab for calculating per-person carbon emissions. Once routes are loaded in, emissions are calculated in terms of carbon dioxide. Ways to offset emissions are also given in terms of calculated environmental donation and tree equivalent values.",
